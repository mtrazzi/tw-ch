In this super scientific study we show that having massive amounts of twitter follower clearly implies tons of clubhouse fame.

Also, if you changed your picture between twitter and clubhouse you're more likely to be on the upper left side of the curve, which is kinda better at clubhouse than twitter, but not part of the VIP club (upper right).

## What you need

### Data

Just create a kaggle account then download that juicy clubhouse [data](https://www.kaggle.com/johntukey/clubhouse-dataset) here, and make sure to call it `Clubhouse_Dataset_v1.db` at the root of the repo (after unzipping).

If you have never used python before:
```bash
pip install numpy sqlite3 pandas requests scipy matplotlib
jupyter notebook
```

Then click on the `tw_ch.ipynb` file and do Kernel > "Restart and run all cells"

### Optional

You might want to get a twitter account with credentials etc. for the v1... only if you want to try with your own followers, otherwise feel free to use data from my followers.
